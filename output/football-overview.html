    <p>The passion, the hard work, the moments of surprise and disbelief when a safe penalty is saved or a game lost with goals is brought out of nowhere. 
Soccer is a sport like no other.</p>
<p>It has an immense and rich history that  many other sports lack. It has a global appeal because it can be played in the most difficult climates, 
from the cold temperatures of Russia to the tropical countries of Brazil. And it gives  the bigger and smaller players different advantages, 
making them both so competitive  (unlike basketball and football). It can be played in almost any  weather (unlike cricket) and  is a team game where 
the individual is important. Connect different population groups into one, a truly global sport! No, it is more than a sport, it is life itself! 
But if you have to honor two people to make  the most popular sport even more attractive to the next generation, you can't think of any other names 
than these two: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi</p>
